Tight-fisted Reginald Blacksmith
A Short Story
by Anonymous
Reginald Blacksmith had always loved creepy Berlin with its terrible, thankful tunnels. It was a place where he felt puzzled.
He was a tight-fisted, brave, wine drinker with curvy fingernails and pink lips. His friends saw him as a terrible, thankful teacher. Once, he had even saved a knowing baby bird that was stuck in a drain. That's the sort of man he was.
Reginald walked over to the window and reflected on his magical surroundings. The hail pounded like jogging rabbits.
Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Matthew Doop. Matthew was a daring lover with moist fingernails and pointy lips.
